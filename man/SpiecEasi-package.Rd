\title{SpiecEasi: Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference}
\value{
This package provides functions for microbiome network inference and analysis
}
\description{
SpiecEasi provides methods for inferring ecological associations from compositional microbiome data using sparse inverse covariance estimation.
}
\details{
The package implements SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance estimation for Ecological Association Inference) methods for microbiome network inference, including glasso and neighborhood selection approaches with stability selection for model selection.
